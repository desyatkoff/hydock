## What You Can Contribute

Basically everything:

* Bug reports
* Fixes and refactors
* New features
* Documentation improvements
* Tests and test fixes

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standard, so your commit messages should follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Preferred type labels and their use cases:

* `feat` - A new feature implementation
* `impr` - An existing feature improvement
* `fix` - A bug fix
* `docs` - Documentation updates
* `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `build` - Build system changes or dependencies changes
* `chore` - Everything else

Example commit messages:

* `feat: add cool button`
* `impr: optimize cool button so it will work faster`
* `fix: fix cool button didn't work on Mondays`
* `docs: add "Configuration" section in README.md`
* `refactor: remove unused block of code`
* `build: add "serde" as dependency in Cargo.toml`
* `chore: update demo_1.png`

## Pull Request Guidelines

* One feature per PR
* Keep your PR description short but informative
* Tag relevant issues
* Make sure it builds

We'll review as soon as possible!
